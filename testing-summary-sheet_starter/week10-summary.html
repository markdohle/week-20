  <h2 id="create-react-app">Create-React-App</h2>
  <p>
    Create-React-App is a command you can run via the command line that creates an entirely
    configured React application for you, complete with Babel setup, recommended folder structure,
    and some skeleton files, like a skeleton App.js. To run this command, run this command in your
    command line:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-attribute">npx create-react-app</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>
    After some time downloading, you'll have an entire React application set up so that you can
    start editing the files for your own purposes right away!
  </p>
  <h2 id="graphql">GraphQL</h2>
  <p>
    GraphQL is an API query framework that allows you to specify exactly what data you want from an
    API. This helps with load time by eliminating excess data, and allows for more flexibility in
    the client/server communication stream.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you had an API that had data on gyms in the area (name, hours, amenities,
    membership costs, etc.) and you only wanted to get the name and ID of all the gyms for your app,
    if you went through a traditional API query method, you'd have to wait for a long time for all
    the data and have a lot of extra data to sort through in your app.
  </p>
  <p>A GraphQL query for just the names and IDs of the gyms looks like this:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js">{gyms {<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>}}
</code></pre>
  <p>To see an example in real time, review Dr. William&#39;s video, &quot;GraphQL demo&quot;.</p>
  <h2 id="testing-and-tdd">Testing and TDD</h2>
  <p>
    Testing is such a vast field in engineering that there are entirely separate jobs dedicated to
    it, such as those of Quality Assurance Engineers and Test Engineers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Test driven development is a recent development in the software engineering industry. The
    process of engineering in this manner involves writing a test for the functionality you want
    your code to have, making the test fail, and then writing code in an iterative process to make
    the test pass. This allows for far fewer bugs and a much faster development lifecycle overall.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you want to find out if your application has an H1 tag that contains the text,
    &quot;ToDo&quot;, the test would look like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js">test('ToDo', () =&gt; {
  const root = document.createElement('div')<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  ReactDOM.render(<span class="hljs-name">&lt;App/&gt;</span>, root)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  expect(<span class="hljs-name">root</span>.querySelector(<span class="hljs-string">"h1"</span>).textContent.toBe(<span class="hljs-string">"ToDo"</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>

  <h2 id="mocks">Mocks</h2>
  <p>
    When you're testing your code, oftentimes you’ll need to test your components which have a
    dependency on some other service that has unpredictable results, or takes a long time to receive
    a response from. What you’ll do in those situations is add a “mock”, or fake dependency, so that
    you can focus on testing only what you're building, not the dependency’s functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here&#39;s an example of some React code that displays <code>this is my component</code> to the
    screen:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> ‘react’;

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">myComponent</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ 
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
   <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>this is my component<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now, if you were testing that code, normally you&#39;d test for something like that exact phrase
    being displayed as expected. But what if you wanted to instead &quot;mock&quot; that component
    in your test file, and make it say something else entirely?
  </p>
  <p>That'd look like this:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> ‘react’;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { render } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> ‘@testing-library/react’;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> App <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> ‘./App’;

<span class="hljs-comment">//mock your component here </span>
jest.mock (‘./MyComponent’, () =&gt; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> (<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>Hello, World!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>));

test (‘mocking test’, () =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-comment">//test contents here </span>
});
</code></pre>
  <p>
    As you can see, you're replacing the &quot;this is my component&quot; statement in your original
    component with some new text, and testing if the new text you have put in is displayed instead.
    This type of functionality becomes important when you have data that you don&#39;t necessarily
    want to test, but you need for some other section of your code to run. Instead of using data
    that's large or unpredictable, you can &quot;mock&quot; that data, and focus on the code you
    really want to test.
